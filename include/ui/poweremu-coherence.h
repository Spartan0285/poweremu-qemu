/*
 * Coherence mode: which parts of the guest's screen are its windows.
 *
 * The display bridge needs to know which pixels belong to the guest's
 * windows and which to its desktop, so it can hand PowerEmu a frame whose
 * desktop is transparent and let the windows sit on this Mac's own desktop
 * instead.  Only the GPU model can tell: it watches the copies the guest's
 * compositor makes to the screen.
 *
 * The answer is a grid of tiles over the screen, each holding the kind of
 * the last copy that covered it.  `generation` counts up whenever the grid
 * changes, so a reader can tell when there is nothing new.
